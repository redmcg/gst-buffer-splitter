# GStreamer buffer splitter repository

This git module contains a plugin that includes an element for splitting
buffers in GStreamer.

Example:
```
gst-launch-1.0 --gst-plugin-path=builddir/gst-plugin filesrc location=input.h264 ! buffersplitter ! video/x-h264,stream-format=byte-stream,alignment=nal,framerate=30/1,width=1,height=1 ! avdec_h264 ! xvimagesink
```

## Usage

Configure and build all examples (application and plugins) as such:

    meson builddir
    ninja -C builddir

See <https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html> on how to install the Meson
build system and ninja.

Once the plugin is built you can either install system-wide it with `sudo ninja
-C builddir install` (however, this will by default go into the `/usr/local`
prefix where it won't be picked up by a `GStreamer` installed from packages, so
you would need to set the `GST_PLUGIN_PATH` environment variable to include or
point to `/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0/` for your plugin to be found by a
from-package `GStreamer`).

Alternatively, you will find your plugin binary in `builddir/gst-plugins/src/`
as `libgstplugin.so` or similar (the extension may vary), so you can also set
the `GST_PLUGIN_PATH` environment variable to the `builddir/gst-plugins/src/`
directory (best to specify an absolute path though).

You can also check if it has been built correctly with:

    gst-inspect-1.0 builddir/gst-plugin/libgstbuffersplitter.so
